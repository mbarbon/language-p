Parsing:
- scalar/array/void context
  - prototypes
  - splice/substr/lvalue subroutines
- filetest
  - after filetest, foo and _ are not barewords
  - parse using normal parsing for named unary operators,
    and add parsing prototype
- stashes
- global variables/symbols (STDOUT!)
- local variables
- scoping
- do ...
- labels
- formats
- add operator descriptor and do parse tree modifications
  - like: defined &foo; pipe X, Y; etc.
- indirect method calls
  - find more corner cases
- list slices ( ... )[ ... ]
- test all unary/binary operator
- anonymous sub
- subroutine prototypes
  - declaration
  - parsing
    - & as first parameter permits either:
      mymap { ... } 1, 2, 3
      mymap sub { ... }, 1, 2, 3
      myeval { ... }, 1 == myeval( sub { ... } ), 1
- local()
- implicit $_ in various builtins
- parsing of loop + continue
- scope handling of conditional/while/continue
- handling of parse errors with recovery
- lexical pragmas/hints
  - strictures
- proper lexing of ${  id # comment\n } vs. ${ id # comment \n expr }
- more tests for ${foo[.......} crazy cases
- proper check for overridable builtins (only if imported)
- builtins overridable using CORE::GLOBAL
- CORE::builtin to always call builtin
- special treatment for glob()
- simplify detection of <foo> vs. <foo >, avoid constructing a lexer
- packages
  - add subpackages to runtime
  - when searching prototypes/definitions/variables at parse time,
    use the correct package name
  - package handling in our()
- parsing of nullary/unary vs. list operators
- => auto-quoting
  - => quoting of -foo => 1
- quoted strings
  - \Q\L\U\E in quoted strings/patterns
  - \xaf, \011,etc when lexing quoted strings
- regexp
  - char classes
    - [a-\w] is not a range
    - [a-] is not a range
    - [[] is a "["
    - ^ negation
  - other metacharacters
  - backreferences, also in substitution
  - magic variables
  - (?...) syntax and grouping
  - empty pattern
  - flags
  - context-dependent bexaviour
  - always a pattern after =~/!~
  - tr/// lexing/parsing
- correct parsing of heredoc in substitutions (s//<<HEREDOC/e)

Runtime:
- integer -> float on overflow (also in parsing!)
- proper scalar polimorphing
  - mixed-mode arithmetic
- proper handling of function return values
  - implicit return
  - context
- encapsulate lexical lookup/closure
- better handling of sub calls
  - encapsulate enter/leave
- proper morphing on scalar assignment
- autovivification
- create common superclass for reference/scalar
- multiple dispatch operators
- array/list/hash assignment
  - optimize lists with common assignments
  - check mixed assignments
- garbage collection
- do file/require/use/eval string

Refactoring:
- check offsets for call sequence, refactor stack handling
- proper handling of bytecode
- replace all strings with integer constants/flags
  - move information about bultins/overridables to a separate module
    (currently in both lexer and parse-tree)
- remove dependency from parser to implementation (::Values, scratchpad)
- rewrite lexer to use /\G.../g instead of s///
  - assert unlexed tokens are relexed with the correct expectations
  - assert lex_string/lex unlex buffers do not intermingle
- separate compile-time lexicals from run-time scratchpads
- make regexp parser a full blown parser, not the hack it is;
  add a lexer subclass for parsing patterns
- detect builtins that could have an indirect object as first argument
  earlier in the parsing
